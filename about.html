            <h1>INSPIRATION</h1>
            <p>
                Growing up, my grandmother and mother introduced me to the healing benefits of
                ginger lemon (lomi) tea. &nbsp;The name Lomi comes from the Amharic word for lemon (ሎሚ), which is known
                for
                its cleansing and healing properties across cultures. &nbsp;This
                longstanding staple of healing has been a part of my life since childhood, and it inspired me to
                incorporate it into my health coaching practice. &nbsp;In my search for names, I wanted one that
                would signify the transformative
                power of
                health coaching. &nbsp;The name Lomi reflects this journey. &nbsp;The colors of lemons, yellow and
                green, are
                natural symbols of optimism and newness. &nbsp;They represent the idea of fresh starts and new
                beginnings.

                <h1>ABOUT ELON HAILU</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Elon Hailu, a mindbodygreen Health Coach, and first-generation immigrant from Ethiopia.
                    &nbsp;I stumbled into the world of health coaching by accident, but it turned out to be my true
                    calling.
                    &nbsp;After leaving medical school and a long-term relationship, I knew I wanted to pursue a career
                    that not only promoted my own healing but also the collective healing of others. &nbsp;Health
                    coaching
                    was the perfect fit for me, and I've never looked back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My passion for healing has been with me from a young age, but it wasn't until I approached it from a
                    more holistic lens that I truly found my calling. &nbsp;Through my work as a health coach, I help
                    people embrace a more well-rounded and fulfilling approach to their health journey. &nbsp;I firmly
                    believe that a person's healing journey doesn't begin after a diagnosis or health crisis; rather, it
                    begins
                    in the
                    moments after, when we decide to take action to improve our lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a health coach, my job is to empower my clients to make those changes and turn their health goals
                    into reality. &nbsp;During our sessions, we'll tap into your strengths and successes to inspire more
                    positive changes. &nbsp;I take a person-centered approach, focusing on your unique needs, goals, and
                    challenges. &nbsp;Whether you're struggling with stress management, healthy eating habits, or simply
                    want to feel more energized and balanced, I'm here to guide and support you every step of the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a first-generation immigrant, I understand the unique challenges and pressures that come with
                    navigating a new culture and trying to find your place in the world. &nbsp;That's why I'm passionate
                    about helping others embrace their own individual paths and achieve their personal goals.
                    &nbsp;Let's work together to create a healthier, happier, and more fulfilling life for you.</p>
