                <!-- Lomi ሎሚ is the Amharic word for lemon.
                &nbsp;In my search for names, I wanted a word that signified
                a cleansing. &nbsp;Lemon is a healing element across many cultures used for cleansing and healing.
                &nbsp;Ginger lemon tea has been a longstanding staple of healing since I was a child. &nbsp;It was
                given to me by my grandmother and mother. &nbsp;The colors of lemons, yellow and green, are natural symbols of optimism and newness. &nbsp;It is symbolic of how health coaching is meant to cleanse away old conditioning to form healthier habits. 
             -->
                Growing up, my grandmother and mother introduced me to the healing benefits of
                ginger lemon (lomi) tea. &nbsp;The name Lomi comes from the Amharic word for lemon (ሎሚ), which is known
                for
                its cleansing and healing properties across cultures. &nbsp;This
                longstanding staple of healing has been a part of my life since childhood, and it inspired me to
                incorporate it into my health coaching practice. &nbsp;In my search for names, I wanted one that
                would signify the transformative
                power of
                health coaching. &nbsp;The name Lomi reflects this journey. &nbsp;The colors of lemons, yellow and
                green, are
                natural symbols of optimism and newness. &nbsp;They represent the idea of fresh starts and new
                beginnings.

                <h3>WHAT is health coaching?</h3>
                <p>
                    Health coaching is a profession that utilizes proven behavioral change theories to help individuals
                    achieve their health and wellness goals. taking a whole person approach to health, recognizing that
                    health is not just the absence of disease, but a state of complete physical, mental, emotional,
                    environmental, financial, and spiritual well-being. My coaching approach is based on proven
                    behavioral change theories, such as Motivational Interviewing and Appreciative Inquiry in order to
                    empower clients in making long-term, sustainable, changes in their health.
